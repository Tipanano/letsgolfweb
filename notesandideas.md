Allow different camera angles, reverse, green, follow ball, player, tee

Add bunkers, various roughs, water, path, pines, native 

Better calculation of ball flight, use all the timings to figure out club path and face angle and use that to figure out ball flight instead

On setup, allow for setting in to out or out to in, and club face angle

Add wind and how it impacts ball flight

better description of shot, "good strikes" are either high draw, high fade, low draw, regular straight etc. And then we have fat and thin shots as well

See if if we can implement height on greens at least, if not in 3d, maybe just coloring if not?

Allow to change clubs with numbers

Allow multiplayer with invite codes

Allow wagering on shots or holes using Nano

Allow having friends you can compete with

Play courses and tournaments with friends and not friends with prizes
